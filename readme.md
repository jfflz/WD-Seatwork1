Overview
This project, WD-Lioness-Reflections, is a multi-page website that serves as a personal portfolio and educational resource, reflecting my deep interest in lionesses. It's a journey to understand and share insights into their strength, social bonds, and survival in the wild, built through a series of web design exercises.

Purpose:

To document my learning and understanding of lioness behavior and ecology.

To showcase personal web development skills through practical application.

To create a visually engaging platform that combines personal interest with technical execution.

To provide a structured overview of key lioness characteristics and my design interpretations.

Key Components
Home Page (index.html): The entry point to my lioness exploration, featuring a personal introduction and navigation to thematic sections.

Header Design Interpretations (page1/index.html): A collection of header layouts, each designed to evoke different aspects of the lioness's world or my personal connection to the theme.

Footer Design Concepts (page2/index.html): Various footer designs, including contact details, social links, and navigational elements, reflecting a blend of personal branding and functional design.

Informative Content: Sections dedicated to lioness social structures, hunting techniques, and cub rearing, presented with a personal touch.

Interactive Navigation: Smooth transitions and clear links for an intuitive user experience across the different pages.

Technology
Tailwind CSS: Utilized for rapid and responsive styling, allowing focus on content and structure.

Font Awesome: Integrated for modern and scalable icons, enhancing visual appeal.

Rules, Practices and Principles
Always use WD- in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.

Do not rename any .html files; always use index.html as the filename.

Place Files in their respective folders.

All file naming are in camel case.

Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.

ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css

Use only External CSS.

Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
